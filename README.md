# ⚖️ JusticeGPT

### AI-Powered Legal Research & Case Intelligence Platform for Indian Law

JusticeGPT is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based legal assistant designed to provide accurate, source-backed answers from Indian statutes, legal provisions, and judicial decisions.

Unlike general-purpose AI chatbots, JusticeGPT retrieves relevant legal documents before generating a response, ensuring that answers are grounded in authoritative legal sources rather than relying solely on the model's internal knowledge.

# 🚀 Why JusticeGPT?

Traditional AI models are powerful conversational systems, but they have limitations when used for legal research.

### Normal GPT

A standard Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT:

* Generates responses based on patterns learned during training.
* May not have access to the latest legal documents.
* Can occasionally produce inaccurate or hallucinated information.
* Usually cannot show the exact source used to generate an answer.
* Is not optimized for domain-specific legal research.

### JusticeGPT (RAG-Based AI)

JusticeGPT combines Large Language Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

1. User asks a legal question.
2. Relevant legal statutes and judgments are retrieved from the knowledge base.
3. The retrieved documents are provided as context to the LLM.
4. The LLM generates an answer grounded in actual legal sources.
5. Supporting documents and citations are displayed to the user.

This approach significantly improves reliability, transparency, and explainability.
